## Why?

Many people use visual studio DotNetNuke project templates for their Dnn development. I have a number of issues with project templates - which I describe: https://github.com/dazinator/DnnPackager/wiki/Why-not-use-a-DotNetNuke-Project-Template!%3F

I have tried to eliminate the need for project templates, and instead take advantage of NuGet and the Package Manager Console to streamline Dnn development. This is the same principal that Entity Framework Code First uses.
